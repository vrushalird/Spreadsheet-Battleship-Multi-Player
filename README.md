# Spreadsheet Battleship (Multi-Player Version)

## About
* A multi-player version of classic Battleship game which can be played in Microsoft Excel.
* Consists of a 10x10 grid where Players can place their 5 ships each of different size.
* Suitable for online team bonding activities.
* Was originally made for Team Wrapping activities conducted on every Friday in my office.

## How to Play 
1. Download the files from Host Template and Players Template.
2. Host will distribute Players Template file with the team by updating "Your Ship" tab with individual Players' name. This is just to track each player's sheet.
3. Players will take 10 minutes to place their ships on Battleship board. Please refer Players template file for more instructions.
3. Host will consolidate all Players sheets into Host file.
4. Host will Click on Create Players Table button. This will create a score table for each player in the Host sheet.
6. First player (Attacker) will tell his/her firing shot. Host will navigate to that cell location and enter X. It will determine whose ship was Hit/Sunk and total number of Hits/Sunks among all Players.
7. Other players (Defenders) will mark their Battleship board with X if their ship is Hit, and with O if it is a Miss.
8. Attacker will track his shots in the enemy ship with X if it hits any Players ship. There is no need to mark with O if it is a Miss.
9. Host will track players shot in the Shots tab by entering X. It will be automatically converted to O if none of the Players' ship was hit.
10. The last player with remaining ship becomes the winner and the one with highest score will become the runner up.

## Score Criteria
* <b>Hit</b> - Score 1 per player

## Note
